            <b>Some words on statictics:</b><br>
                Tables below are citing the 90% C.I. of those parameters. 
                In the contour plots, each line correspond to an isocontour at 90% percentile. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Apparently, accessing files from the clusters is not particularly efficient, especially for those large kick plots. <br>
                Hence, it may take a couple minutes to load up all the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, since most content here are loaded, not hard-coded, this webpage will take up huge amount of memory <br>
                It is strongly not recommended to reload this page too hastily, and close this page as soon as you are done with it. <br>
                (Unless you have a really powerful machine with unlimited memory) <br>
                I am considering to also setup a page without the kick plots, that way it will be much smoother.

            While you are waiting, how about we have a 
            <h4>Brief tour on how did we arrive to here.</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-compute the statistics and contour plots of all results</li>
                <li>Group them into a big json file</li>
                <li>Use a plotting script to read and plot them -> the big contour plots</li>
                <li>From the same json file, extract the statistics part and format them as LaTeX tables, and save them into txt files.</li>
                <li>Use MathJax to compile those LaTeX tables in HTML.</li>
                <li>Plot those kicks with Plotly, export them as HTML div blocks.</li>
                <li>Import them into this same HTML with js.</li>
            </ol>
